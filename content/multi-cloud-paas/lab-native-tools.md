## GCP

1. Open [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Run this sc
3.  ```
    # Clone the Repository
    git clone https://github.com/vkhazin/courseware-nodejs-container.git
    
    # Change Directory to where we have server.js file
    cd courseware-nodejs-container/api
    ```
4. Modify server.js and change the module export syntax
5. ```
    # Before Modification
    module.exports = app
    
    # After Modification
    module.exports = {
        app
    };
    ```
6. Create a new file in the root directory where DockerFile is placed and name it `app.yaml` with following code:
7. ```
    runtime: custom
    env: flex
    ```
8. Now just deploy this container to App Engine
9. `gcloud app deploy`
10. This will start the deployment. Once it completes with a success message, to test it run this command
11. `gcloud app browse`
12. This will responf with url for the deployed API you can copy/paste in browser to access the endpoint
